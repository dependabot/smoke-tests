                <h2>2.0.1</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Fix bug of parsing map-values with default values.</li>
                <li>Merge fixes from version <code>1.1.2</code> - <code>1.1.4</code> into v2.</li>

                <li>Fix comparison of empty lists from frozen messages.</li>
                <li>Switch repo internals to use <code>dart format</code> instead of <code>dartfmt</code>.</li>

                <ul>
                <li>Fix that fixed32 int could be negative.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>1.1.2</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Fix proto deserialization issue for repeated and map enum value fields where
                the enum value is unknown.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>1.1.1</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Fix decoding of <code>oneof</code> fields from proto3 json. The 'whichFoo' state would
                not be set.</li>
                <li>Fix the return type of <code>copyWith</code>.</li>

                <h2>1.1.0</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Require at least Dart SDK 2.7.0 to enable usage of extension methods.</li>
                <li>Introduce extension methods <code>GeneratedMessage.rebuild</code> and <code>GeneratedMessage.deepCopy</code> replacing <code>copyWith</code> and <code>clone</code>. Using these  alternatives can result in smaller binaries, because it is defined once instead of once per class. Use <code>protoc_plugin</code> from 19.1.0 to generate deprecation warnings for <code>copyWith</code> and <code>clone</code> methods.</li>
                <li><code>GeneratedMessage.getExtension</code> throws when reading trying to read an extension that is present in the unknown fields. We consider this change a bug-fix because depending on the old behavior is indicative of a bug in your program.</li>

                <h2>1.0.4</h2>
                <ul>

                <li>Update pedantic to 1.9.2</li>

                <h2>1.0.3</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Enable hashCode memoization for frozen protos.</li>
                <li>Add <code>timeout</code> to <code>ClientContext</code></li>

                <ul>
                <li>Fix hashcode of bytes fields.</li>
                <li>Fix issue with the <code>permissiveEnums</code> option to <code>mergeFromProto3Json</code>. The comparison did not work properly.</li>
