# Minimal BUILD file for WORKSPACE-based Bazel workspace
# This is required at the root of a Bazel workspace

# Empty package declaration - allows this directory to be a valid Bazel package
package(default_visibility = ["//visibility:public"])

# Simple filegroup target for testing
filegroup(
    name = "all_files",
    srcs = ["WORKSPACE", "BUILD"],
